This module implements a tree traversal algorithm for simulating quantum circuits with mid-circuit measurements (MCMs) using PennyLane's Lightning backend. The core functionality enables the simulation of dynamic quantum circuits, including support for post-selection, shot vectors, and various measurement types (expectation, probability, sample, counts, and variance).

    """Simulate a single quantum script with native mid-circuit measurements using the tree-traversal algorithm.

    The tree-traversal algorithm recursively explores all combinations of mid-circuit measurement
    outcomes using a depth-first approach. The depth-first approach requires ``n_mcm`` copies
    of the state vector (``n_mcm + 1`` state vectors in total) and records ``n_mcm`` vectors
    of mid-circuit measurement samples. It is generally more efficient than ``one-shot`` because it takes all samples
    at a leaf at once and stops exploring more branches when a single shot is allocated to a sub-tree.

    Args:
        circuit (QuantumTape): The single circuit to simulate
        lightning_state (LightningBaseStateVector): The state vector.
        lightning_measurement (LightningBaseMeasurements): The measurement class used to perform measurements
        postselect_mode (str): Configuration for shots with mid-circuit measurement

    Returns:
