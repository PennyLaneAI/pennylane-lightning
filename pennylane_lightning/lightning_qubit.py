The default plugin is meant to be used as a template for writing PennyLane device
plugins for new qubit-based backends.

It implements the necessary :class:`~pennylane._device.Device` methods as well as some built-in
:mod:`qubit operations <pennylane.ops.qubit>`, and provides a very simple pure state
simulation of a qubit-based quantum circuit architecture.
