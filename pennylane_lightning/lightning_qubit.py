    An extension of PennyLane's built-in ``default.qubit`` device that interfaces with C++ to
    perform fast linear algebra calculations.

    Use of this device requires pre-built binaries or compilation from source. Check out the
    :doc:`/installation` guide for more details.

        wires (int): the number of wires to initialize the device with
        shots (int): How many times the circuit should be evaluated (or sampled) to estimate
            the expectation values. Defaults to ``None`` if not specified. Setting
            to ``None`` results in computing statistics like expectation values and
