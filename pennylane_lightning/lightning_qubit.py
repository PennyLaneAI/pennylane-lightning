    """PennyLane Lightning device.

    An extension of PennyLane's built-in ``default.qubit`` device that interfaces with C++ to
    perform fast linear algebra calculations using the
    `Eigen <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page>`__ library.

    Use of this device requires pre-built binaries or compilation from source. Check out the
    :doc:`/installation` guide for more details.

    .. warning::

        The C++ interface currently supports up to 16 wires. If Lightning Qubit is loaded with
        more than 16 wires, it will revert to a NumPy-based simulation.

    Args:
        wires (int): the number of wires to initialize the device with
        shots (int): How many times the circuit should be evaluated (or sampled) to estimate
            the expectation values. Defaults to 1000 if not specified.
            If ``analytic == True``, then the number of shots is ignored
            in the calculation of expectation values and variances, and only controls the number
            of samples returned by ``sample``.
        analytic (bool): indicates if the device should calculate expectations
            and variances analytically
