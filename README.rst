The PennyLane-Lightning plugin provides a fast state-vector simulator written in C++.

`PennyLane <https://docs.pennylane.ai>`_ is a cross-platform Python library for quantum machine
learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

Features
========

* Combine PennyLane-Lightning's high performance simulator with PennyLane's
  automatic differentiation and optimization.

.. installation-start-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove


Installation
============

PennyLane-Lightning requires Python version 3.7 and above. It can be installed using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pennylane-lightning

To build PennyLane-Lightning from source you can run

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pybind11 pennylane-lightning --no-binary :all:

A C++ compiler such as ``g++``, ``clang``, or ``MSVC`` is required. On Debian-based systems, this
can be installed via ``apt``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo apt install g++

The `pybind11 <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ library is also used for binding the
C++ functionality to Python.

Alternatively, for development and testing, you can install by cloning the repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning.git
    $ cd pennylane-lightning
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install -e .

Note that subsequent calls to ``pip install -e .`` will use cached binaries stored in the
``build`` folder. Run ``make clean`` if you would like to recompile.

You can also pass ``cmake`` options with ``build_ext``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 setup.py build_ext -i --define="ENABLE_OPENMP=OFF;ENABLE_NATIVE=ON"

and install the compilied library with

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 setup.py develop


GPU support
-----------

For GPU support, `PennyLane-Lightning-GPU <https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning-gpu>`_ can be installed by providing the optional ``[gpu]`` tag:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pennylane-lightning[gpu]

For more information, please refer to the PennyLane Lightning GPU `documentation <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/lightning-gpu>`_.

Testing
-------

To test that the plugin is working correctly you can test the Python code within the cloned
repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make test-python

while the C++ code can be tested with

.. code-block:: console

    $ make test-cpp


CMake Support
-------------

One can also build the plugin using CMake:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cmake -S. -B build
    $ cmake --build build

To test the C++ code:

.. code-block:: console

    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
    $ make

Other supported options are ``-DENABLE_WARNINGS=ON``,
``-DENABLE_NATIVE=ON`` (for ``-march=native``),  
``-DENABLE_BLAS=ON``, ``-DENABLE_OPENMP=ON``, 
``-DENABLE_KOKKOS=ON``, and ``-DENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=ON``.

Compile on Windows with MSVC
----------------------------

You can also compile Pennylane-Lightning on Windows using `Microsoft Visual C++ <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/>`_ compiler. You need `cmake <https://cmake.org/download/>`_ and appropriate Python environment (e.g. using `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_).


We recommend to use ``[x64 (or x86)] Native Tools Command Prompt for VS [version]`` for compiling the library. Be sure that ``cmake`` and ``python`` can be called within the prompt.


.. code-block:: console

    $ cmake --version
    $ python --version

Then a common command will work.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install -e .

Note that OpenMP and BLAS are disabled in this setting.

Please refer to the `plugin documentation <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/lightning/>`_ as
well as to the `PennyLane documentation <https://docs.pennylane.ai/>`_ for further reference.


Docker Support
--------------
One can also build the Pennylane-Lightning image using Docker:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning.git
    $ cd pennylane-lightning
    $ docker build -t lightning/base -f docker/Dockerfile .

Please refer to the `PennyLane installation <https://docs.pennylane.ai/en/stable/development/guide/installation.html#installation>`_ for detailed description about PennyLane Docker support.
