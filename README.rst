The PennyLane-Lightning plugin provides a fast state-vector simulator written in C++.

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_ is a cross-platform Python library for quantum machine
learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

Features
========

* Combine PennyLane-Lightning's high performance simulator with PennyLane's
  automatic differentiation and optimization.

.. installation-start-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove

Installation
============

PennyLane-Lightning requires Python version 3.7 and above. It can be installed using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pennylane-lightning

To build PennyLane-Lightning from source you can run

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pybind11 pennylane-lightning --no-binary :all:

A C++ compiler such as ``g++``, ``clang``, or ``MSVC`` is required. On Debian-based systems, this
can be installed via ``apt``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo apt install g++

The `pybind11 <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ library is also used for binding the
C++ functionality to Python.

Alternatively, for development and testing, you can install by cloning the repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-lightning.git
    $ cd pennylane-lightning
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ pip install -e .

Note that subsequent calls to ``pip install -e .`` will use cached binaries stored in the
``build`` folder. Run ``make clean`` if you would like to recompile.

Testing
-------

To test that the plugin is working correctly you can test the Python code within the cloned
repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ make test-python

while the C++ code can be tested with

.. code-block:: console

    $ make test-cpp

Testing the C++ code requires the `GoogleTest <https://github.com/google/googletest>`__ framework.

CMake Support
-------------

One can also build the plugin using CMake:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cmake -S. -B build
    $ cmake --build build

and install 
    
.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -e .

To test the C++ code:

.. code-block:: console

    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
    $ make cpptests
    $ make test

Other supported options are ``-DENABLE_NATIVE=ON`` (for ``-march=native``), ``-DUSE_LAPACK=ON``, and ``-DUSE_OPENBLAS=ON``.
