The Lightning plugin ecosystem provides fast state-vector and tensor network simulators written in C++.

`PennyLane <https://docs.pennylane.ai>`_ is a cross-platform Python library for quantum machine
learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.
PennyLane supports Python 3.10 and above.

Features
********

PennyLane-Lightning high performance simulators include the following backends:

* ``lightning.qubit``: is a fast state-vector simulator written in C++.
* ``lightning.gpu``: is a state-vector simulator based on the `NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuquantum-sdk>`_. It notably implements a distributed state-vector simulator based on MPI.
* ``lightning.kokkos``: is a state-vector simulator written with `Kokkos <https://kokkos.github.io/kokkos-core-wiki/index.html>`_. It can exploit the inherent parallelism of modern processing units supporting the `OpenMP <https://www.openmp.org/>`_, `CUDA <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit>`_ or `HIP <https://docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/docs-5.3.0/index.html>`_ programming models.
* ``lightning.tensor``: is a tensor network simulator based on the `NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuquantum-sdk>`_ (requires NVIDIA GPUs with SM 7.0 or greater). The supported method is Matrix Product State (MPS).

Lightning-Qubit installation
****************************

Standard installation
=====================
| **Lightning-Qubit comes pre-installed with PennyLane.**
| Please follow our `installation instructions <https://pennylane.ai/install/#high-performance-computing-and-gpus>`_ to install PennyLane.

Install from source
===================

.. note::

    The below contains instructions for installing Lightning-Qubit ***from source***. For most cases, *this is not required* and one can simply use the installation instructions at `pennylane.ai/install <https://pennylane.ai/install>`__.
    If those instructions do not work for you, or you have a more complex build environment that requires building from source, then consider reading on.

To build Lightning plugins from source you can run

.. code-block:: bash

    PL_BACKEND=${PL_BACKEND} pip install pybind11 pennylane-lightning --no-binary :all:

where ``${PL_BACKEND}`` can be ``lightning_qubit`` (default), ``lightning_gpu``,  ``lightning_kokkos``, or ``lightning_tensor``.
The `pybind11 <https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ library is required to bind the C++ functionality to Python.

A C++ compiler such as ``g++``, ``clang++``, or ``MSVC`` is required.
On Debian-based systems, this can be installed via ``apt``:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt -y update && sudo apt install -y g++ libomp-dev

where ``libomp-dev`` is included to also install OpenMP.
On MacOS, we recommend using the latest version of ``clang++`` and ``libomp``:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install llvm libomp

The Lightning-GPU backend has several dependencies (e.g. ``CUDA``, ``custatevec-cu12``, etc.), and hence we recommend referring to `Lightning-GPU installation <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/lightning/en/stable/lightning_gpu/installation.html>`_ section.
Similarly, for Lightning-Kokkos it is recommended to configure and install Kokkos independently as prescribed in the `Lightning-Kokkos installation <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/lightning/en/stable/lightning_kokkos/installation.html>`_ section.

Development installation
========================

For development and testing, you can install by cloning the repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning.git
    cd pennylane-lightning
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    PL_BACKEND=${PL_BACKEND} python scripts/configure_pyproject_toml.py
    pip install -e . --config-settings editable_mode=compat -vv

Note that subsequent calls to ``pip install -e .`` will use cached binaries stored in the
``build`` folder, and the ``pyproject.toml`` file defined by the configuration script. Run ``make clean`` if you would like to recompile from scratch.

You can also pass ``cmake`` options with ``CMAKE_ARGS`` as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    CMAKE_ARGS="-DENABLE_OPENMP=OFF -DENABLE_BLAS=OFF" pip install -e . --config-settings editable_mode=compat -vv
    

Supported options are ``-DENABLE_WARNINGS``, ``-DENABLE_NATIVE`` (for ``-march=native``) ``-DENABLE_BLAS``, ``-DENABLE_OPENMP``,  and ``-DENABLE_CLANG_TIDY``.

Compile MSVC (Windows)
======================

Lightning-Qubit can be compiled on Windows using the
`Microsoft Visual C++ <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/>`_ compiler.
You need `cmake <https://cmake.org/download/>`_ and appropriate Python environment
(e.g. using `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_).

We recommend using ``[x64 (or x86)] Native Tools Command Prompt for VS [version]`` to compile the library.
Be sure that ``cmake`` and ``python`` can be called within the prompt.

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake --version
    python --version

Then a common command will work.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e . 

Note that OpenMP and BLAS are disabled on this platform.


Testing
=======

To test that a plugin is working correctly, one can check both Python and C++ unit tests for each device.

Python Test
^^^^^^^^^^^ 

Test the Python code with:

.. code-block:: bash

    make test-python device=${PL.DEVICE}

where ``${PL.DEVICE}`` differ from ``${PL_BACKEND}`` by replacing the underscore by a dot. And can be 

- ``lightning.qubit`` (default) 
- ``lightning.gpu``  
- ``lightning.kokkos``
- ``lightning.tensor``

C++ Test
^^^^^^^^
 
The C++ code can be tested with

.. code-block:: bash

    PL_BACKEND=${PL_BACKEND} make test-cpp

.. installation_LQubit-end-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove

.. installation_LGPU-start-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove


Lightning-GPU installation
**************************

Standard installation
=====================
| For the majority of cases,
| Lightning-GPU can be installed by following our installation instructions at `pennylane.ai/install <https://pennylane.ai/install/#high-performance-computing-and-gpus>`__.

Install Lightning-GPU from source
=================================

.. note::

    The below contains instructions for installing Lightning-GPU ***from source***. For most cases, *this is not required* and one can simply use the installation instructions at `pennylane.ai/install <https://pennylane.ai/install/#high-performance-computing-and-gpus>`__. If those instructions do not work for you, or you have a more complex build environment that requires building from source, then consider reading on.

To install Lightning-GPU from the package sources using the direct SDK path, Lightning-Qubit should be install before Lightning-GPU (compilation is not necessary):

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning.git
    cd pennylane-lightning
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install custatevec-cu12
    PL_BACKEND="lightning_qubit" python scripts/configure_pyproject_toml.py
    SKIP_COMPILATION=True pip install -e . --config-settings editable_mode=compat -vv

Then a ``CUQUANTUM_SDK`` environment variable can be set:

.. code-block:: bash

    export CUQUANTUM_SDK=$(python -c "import site; print( f'{site.getsitepackages()[0]}/cuquantum')")

The Lightning-GPU can then be installed with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    PL_BACKEND="lightning_gpu" python scripts/configure_pyproject_toml.py
    python -m pip install -e . --config-settings editable_mode=compat -vv

To simplify the build, we recommend using the containerized build process described in Docker support section.

Install Lightning-GPU with MPI
==============================

Building Lightning-GPU with MPI also requires the ``NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK`` (currently supported version: `custatevec-cu12 <https://pypi.org/project/cuquantum-cu12/>`_), ``mpi4py`` and ``CUDA-aware MPI`` (Message Passing Interface).
``CUDA-aware MPI`` allows data exchange between GPU memory spaces of different nodes without the need for CPU-mediated transfers.
Both the ``MPICH`` and ``OpenMPI`` libraries are supported, provided they are compiled with CUDA support.
The path to ``libmpi.so`` should be found in ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``.
It is recommended to install the ``NVIDIA cuQuantum SDK`` and ``mpi4py`` Python package within ``pip`` or ``conda`` inside a virtual environment.
Please consult the `cuQuantum SDK`_ , `mpi4py <https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html>`_,
`MPICH <https://www.mpich.org/static/downloads/4.1.1/mpich-4.1.1-README.txt>`_, or `OpenMPI <https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=buildcuda>`_ install guide for more information.

Before installing Lightning-GPU with MPI support using the direct SDK path, please ensure Lightning-Qubit, ``CUDA-aware MPI`` and ``custatevec`` are installed and the environment variable ``CUQUANTUM_SDK`` is set properly.
Then Lightning-GPU with MPI support can then be installed in the *editable* mode:

.. code-block:: bash

    PL_BACKEND="lightning_gpu" python scripts/configure_pyproject_toml.py
    CMAKE_ARGS="-DENABLE_MPI=ON" python -m pip install -e . --config-settings editable_mode=compat -vv


Test Lightning-GPU with MPI
===========================

You may test the Python layer of the MPI enabled plugin as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    mpirun -np 2 python -m pytest mpitests --tb=short

The C++ code is tested with

.. code-block:: bash

    rm -rf ./BuildTests
    cmake . -BBuildTests -DBUILD_TESTS=1 -DBUILD_TESTS=1 -DENABLE_MPI=ON -DCUQUANTUM_SDK=<path to sdk>
    cmake --build ./BuildTests --verbose
    cd ./BuildTests
    for file in *runner_mpi ; do mpirun -np 2 ./BuildTests/$file ; done;

Lightning-Kokkos installation
*****************************

Standard installation
=====================
| On most Linux systems,
| Lightning-Kokkos can be installed via Spack or Docker by following our installation instructions at `pennylane.ai/install <https://pennylane.ai/install/#high-performance-computing-and-gpus>`__.

Install Lightning-Kokkos from source
====================================

.. note::

    The below contains instructions for installing Lightning-Kokkos ***from source***. For most cases, one can install Lightning-Kokkos via Spack or Docker by the installation instructions at `pennylane.ai/install <https://pennylane.ai/install/#high-performance-computing-and-gpus>`__. If those instructions do not work for you, or you have a more complex build environment that requires building from source, then consider reading on.

As Kokkos enables support for many different HPC-targeted hardware platforms, ``lightning.kokkos`` can be built to support any of these platforms when building from source.

Install Kokkos (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We suggest first installing Kokkos with the wanted configuration following the instructions found in the `Kokkos documentation <https://kokkos.github.io/kokkos-core-wiki/building.html>`_.
For example, the following will build Kokkos for NVIDIA A100 cards

Download the `Kokkos code <https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/releases>`_. Lightning Kokkos was tested with Kokkos version <= 4.3.01  

.. code-block:: bash

    # Replace x, y, and z by the correct version
    wget https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/archive/refs/tags/4.x.yz.tar.gz 
    tar -xvf 4.x.y.z.tar.gz
    cd kokkos-4.x.y.z

Build Kokkos for NVIDIA A100 cards (``SM80`` architecture)

.. code-block:: bash

    cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebugInfo \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/kokkos/4.x.y.z/AMPERE80 \
        -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=20 \
        -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:BOOL=ON \
        -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=OFF \
        -DKokkos_ENABLE_SERIAL:BOOL=ON \
        -DKokkos_ENABLE_CUDA:BOOL=ON \
        -DKokkos_ARCH_AMPERE80:BOOL=ON \
        -DKokkos_ENABLE_EXAMPLES:BOOL=OFF \
        -DKokkos_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=OFF \
        -DKokkos_ENABLE_LIBDL:BOOL=OFF
    cmake --build build && cmake --install build
    export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/kokkos/4.x.y.z/AMPERE80:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH


Next, append the install location to ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``.
Note that the C++20 standard is required (``-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=20`` option), and hence CUDA v12 is required for the CUDA backend.

Install Lightning-Kokkos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an installation of Kokkos is not found, then our builder will clone and install it during the build process. Lightning-Qubit should be installed (compilation is not necessary):

The simplest way to install Lightning-Kokkos (OpenMP backend) through ``pip``.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning.git
    cd pennylane-lightning
    PL_BACKEND="lightning_qubit" python scripts/configure_pyproject_toml.py
    SKIP_COMPILATION=True pip install -e . --config-settings editable_mode=compat
    PL_BACKEND="lightning_kokkos" python scripts/configure_pyproject_toml.py
    CMAKE_ARGS="-DKokkos_ENABLE_OPENMP=ON" python -m pip install -e . --config-settings editable_mode=compat -vv

The supported backend options are 

.. list-table:: 
    :align: center
    :width: 100 %
    :widths: 20 20 20 20 20
    :header-rows: 0

    * - ``SERIAL``
      - ``OPENMP``
      - ``THREADS``
      - ``HIP``
      - ``CUDA`` 

and the corresponding build options are ``-DKokkos_ENABLE_XXX=ON``, where ``XXX`` needs be replaced by the backend name, for instance ``OPENMP``.

One can activate simultaneously one serial, one parallel CPU host (e.g. ``OPENMP``, ``THREADS``) and one parallel GPU device backend (e.g. ``HIP``, ``CUDA``), but not two of any category at the same time.
For ``HIP`` and ``CUDA``, the appropriate software stacks are required to enable compilation and subsequent use.
Similarly, the CMake option ``-DKokkos_ARCH_{...}=ON`` must also be specified to target a given architecture.
A list of the architectures is found on the `Kokkos wiki <https://kokkos.org/kokkos-core-wiki/API/core/Macros.html#architectures>`_.
Note that ``THREADS`` backend is not recommended since `Kokkos does not guarantee its safety <https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-core-wiki/blob/17f08a6483937c26e14ec3c93a2aa40e4ce081ce/docs/source/ProgrammingGuide/Initialization.md?plain=1#L67>`_.

.. installation_LTensor-start-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove


Lightning-Tensor installation
*****************************
Lightning-Tensor requires CUDA 12 and the `cuQuantum SDK <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuquantum-sdk>`_ (only the `cutensornet <https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuquantum/latest/cutensornet/index.html>`_ library is required).
The SDK may be installed within the Python environment ``site-packages`` directory using ``pip`` or ``conda`` or the SDK library path appended to the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment variable.
Please see the `cuQuantum SDK <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuquantum-sdk>`_ install guide for more information.

Standard installation
=====================
| For the majority of cases,
| Lightning-Tensor can be installed by following our installation instructions at `pennylane.ai/install <https://pennylane.ai/install/#high-performance-computing-and-gpus>`__.

Install Lightning-Tensor from source
====================================

.. note::

    The below contains instructions for installing Lightning-Tensor ***from source***. For most cases, *this is not required* and one can simply use the installation instructions at `pennylane.ai/install <https://pennylane.ai/install/#high-performance-computing-and-gpus>`__. If those instructions do not work for you, or you have a more complex build environment that requires building from source, then consider reading on.

Lightning-Qubit should be installed before Lightning-Tensor (compilation is not necessary):

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning.git
    cd pennylane-lightning
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install cutensornet-cu12
    PL_BACKEND="lightning_qubit" python scripts/configure_pyproject_toml.py
    SKIP_COMPILATION=True pip install -e . --config-settings editable_mode=compat

Then a ``CUQUANTUM_SDK`` environment variable can be set:

.. code-block:: bash

    export CUQUANTUM_SDK=$(python -c "import site; print( f'{site.getsitepackages()[0]}/cuquantum')")

The Lightning-Tensor can then be installed with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    PL_BACKEND="lightning_tensor" python scripts/configure_pyproject_toml.py
    pip install -e . --config-settings editable_mode=compat -vv
