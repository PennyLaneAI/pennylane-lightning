Kernel performance tuning
#########################

Lightning-Qubit's kernel implementations are by default tuned for high throughput single-threaded performance with gradient workloads.
To enable this, we add OpenMP threading within the adjoint differentiation method implementation
and use SIMD-level intrinsics to ensure fast performance for each given circuit in such a workload.

However, sometimes we may want to modify the above defaults to favour a given workload, such as by enabling multi-threaded execution of the gate kernels instead.
For this, we have several compile-time flags to change the operating behaviour of Lightning-Qubit kernels.

OpenMP threaded kernels
-----------------------

OpenMP acceleration of gate kernels across all kernel types (LM, AVX2, and AVX512) is enabled
by default on Linux wheels in Lightning-Qubit.

On other operating systems, OpenMP support can be enabled by setting the environment variable
``LQ_ENABLE_KERNEL_OMP=ON`` before starting your Python session, or if already running, before
simulating your PennyLane programs.
You can also control the number of threads used by setting the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS``
environment variable.

For workloads that involve gradient computations with many observable measurements,
OpenMP acceleration may reduce performance compared to the default mode.
To disable it, use the CMake flag ``-DLQ_ENABLE_KERNEL_OMP=OFF`` when building
Lightning-Qubit.

For workloads that show benefit from the use of threaded gate kernels,
sometimes updating the CPU cache to accommodate recently modified data can become a bottleneck,
and saturates the performance gained at high thread counts.
This may be alleviated somewhat on systems supporting AVX2 and AVX-512 operations using
the ``-DLQ_ENABLE_KERNEL_AVX_STREAMING=on`` CMake flag. This forces the data to avoid updating
the CPU cache and can improve performance for larger workloads.
