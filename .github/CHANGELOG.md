# Release 0.18.0

### New features since last release

* PennyLane-Lightning now provides a high-performance
  [adjoint Jacobian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02823) method for differentiating quantum circuits.
  [(#136)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/pull/136)
  
  The adjoint method operates after a forward pass by iteratively applying inverse gates to scan
  backwards through the circuit. The method is already available in PennyLane's
  `default.qubit` device, but the version provided by `lightning.qubit` integrates with the C++
  backend and is more performant, as shown in the plot below:

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/master/doc/_static/lightning_adjoint.png" width=70%/>
  
  The plot compares the average runtime of `lightning.qubit` and `default.qubit` for calculating the
  Jacobian of a circuit using the adjoint method for a range of qubit numbers. The circuit
  consists of ten `BasicEntanglerLayers` with a `PauliZ` expectation value calculated on each wire,
  repeated over ten runs. We see that `lightning.qubit` provides a speedup of around two to eight
  times, depending on the number of qubits.
  
  The adjoint method can be accessed using the standard interface. Consider the following circuit:
  
  ```python
  import pennylane as qml

  wires = 3
  layers = 2
  dev = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=wires)

  @qml.qnode(dev, diff_method="adjoint")
  def circuit(weights):
      qml.templates.StronglyEntanglingLayers(weights, wires=range(wires))
      return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

  weights = qml.init.strong_ent_layers_normal(layers, wires, seed=1967)
  ```
  
  The circuit can be executed and its gradient calculated using:
  
    ```pycon
  >>> print(f"Circuit evaluated: {circuit(weights)}")
  Circuit evaluated: 0.9801286266677633
  >>> print(f"Circuit gradient:\n{qml.grad(circuit)(weights)}")
  Circuit gradient:
  [[[-1.11022302e-16 -1.63051504e-01 -4.14810501e-04]
    [ 1.11022302e-16 -1.50136528e-04 -1.77922957e-04]
    [ 0.00000000e+00 -3.92874550e-02  8.14523075e-05]]

   [[-1.14472273e-04  3.85963953e-02  0.00000000e+00]
    [-5.76791765e-05 -9.78478343e-02  0.00000000e+00]
    [-5.55111512e-17  0.00000000e+00 -1.11022302e-16]]]  
  ```

* PennyLane-Lightning now supports all of the operations and observables of `default.qubit`.
  [(#124)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/pull/124)

### Improvements

* A new state-vector class `StateVectorManaged` was added, enabling memory use to be bound to 
  statevector lifetime.
  [(#136)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/pull/136)

* The repository now has a well-defined component hierarchy, allowing each indepedent unit to be 
  compiled and linked separately.
  [(#136)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/pull/136)

* PennyLane-Lightning can now be installed without compiling its C++ binaries and will fall back
  to using the `default.qubit` implementation. Skipping compilation is achieved by setting the
  `SKIP_COMPILATION` environment variable, e.g., Linux/MacOS: `export SKIP_COMPILATION=True`,
  Windows: `set SKIP_COMPILATION=True`. This feature is intended for building a pure-Python wheel of
  PennyLane-Lightning as a backup for platforms without a dedicated wheel.
  [(#129)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/pull/129)

* The C++-backed Python bound methods can now be directly called with wires and supplied parameters.
  [(#125)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/pull/125)

* Lightning supports arbitrary unitary and non-unitary gate-calls from Python to C++ layer.
  [(#121)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/pull/121)

### Documentation

* Added preliminary architecture diagram for package.
  [(#131)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/pull/131)

* C++ API built as part of docs generation.
  [(#131)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/pull/131)

### Breaking changes

* Wheels for MacOS <= 10.13 will no longer be provided due to XCode SDK C++17 support requirements.
  [(#149)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/pull/149)

### Bug fixes

* An indexing error in the CRY gate is fixed. [(#136)](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-lightning/pull/136)

* Column-major data in numpy is now correctly converted to row-major upon pass to the C++ layer.
